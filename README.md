## motivation
Dealing with complex systems can be a lot of fun. But let's be honest, the road to understanding can sometimes be as bumpy as a mogul slope. Especially when you're a newcomer to the digital world, it feels like you're navigating a jungle without a map.

There are these documentation programs that try to explain every little atom of a topic. Sure, that's important, but not necessarily for someone just starting out. There are also pretty good blogs and platforms that explain the basic concepts quite well. The problem with that? You have to fight your way through endless deserts of text and you need a PhD in imagination and powers of abstraction to see through them.

In this blog, I try to remove all these obstacles. My goal is to illustrate complicated issues in a way that even a five-year-old can understand. And more importantly, I focus on explaining the basic concepts without getting bogged down in endless details.

With any complex topic, I always ask two basic questions:

1. what is actually the problem?
2. what is the solution to it?


I would also like to create a collaborative knowledge platform in the future. Anyone can contribute to the content via GitHub.
